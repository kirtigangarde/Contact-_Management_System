A **Contact Management System** in Python allows users to store and manage contact information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The program typically offers features to add, view, edit, and delete contacts. It may store the data in a file or database for persistence. Users can search for contacts, update details, or remove them as needed, providing a simple way to organize and maintain contact information.
